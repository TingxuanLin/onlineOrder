# Doordash+: A Spring and Hibernate-based online food ordering system
- Implemented REST API via Spring MVC, including registration, menu searching, ordering checkout, etc.
- Utilized Hibernate to access and operate the data storage(menu, restaurants, etc.)
- Provided authentication and authorization via Spring security to protect the application from malicious attacks.
- Used the Spring framework core technologies to loosely decouple all the components in the application.
- Build the client side with ReactJS and Ant Design to allow users to add items to the shopping cart and place orders.
